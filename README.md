Jedi Hosts Manager is a cross-platform application built with Tauri and Vue 3, designed for developers to simplify hosts file management. It allows you to create, edit, and switch between different hosts configuration groups, making development, testing, and deployment processes more efficient.

The name "Jedi" is inspired by the Jedi Knights from Star Wars, symbolizing how this tool helps developers master different network configurations with the ease of a Jedi.

## ðŸ”§ Usage Guide

### Basic Operations

1. **Add Group**: Click the "+" button to create a new hosts configuration group

3. **Enable/Disable Entry**: Use the switch next to each entry to control its status
4. **Global Toggle**: Use the main switch at the top to control all hosts configurations

### Hosts File Format

Jedi uses special format markers to manage content in the hosts file:

```
# === JEDI HOSTS MANAGER ===
# +default+
127.0.0.1 localhost
# +development+
10.50.128.32 docker.dev.io
10.50.128.32 api.dev.io
# === END JEDI HOSTS MANAGER ===
```

Jedi only manages the content between these markers and does not modify other parts of the file.

## ðŸ”’ Permissions

Jedi requires administrator privileges to modify the hosts file. On Windows, it will request UAC elevation; on macOS and Linux, you may need to enter an administrator password.
