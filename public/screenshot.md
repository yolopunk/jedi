# Jedi Hosts Manager Screenshot

This is a placeholder for the actual screenshot of the Jedi Hosts Manager application.

In the actual implementation, you should replace this with a real screenshot image file (PNG, JPG, etc.) showing the application interface with:

1. The main interface with the global toggle switch
2. Several host groups expanded to show their entries
3. Some enabled and some disabled host entries
4. The group management interface

The screenshot should demonstrate the key features of the application, including:
- Group management
- Host entry management
- Toggle switches for enabling/disabling entries
- The modern Vuetify-based UI

Please save an actual screenshot as `screenshot.png` in this directory.
